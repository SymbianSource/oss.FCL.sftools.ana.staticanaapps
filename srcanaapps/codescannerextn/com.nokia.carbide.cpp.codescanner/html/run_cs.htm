<h2>Running CodeScanner </h2>
</div>
   <p>CodeScanner is a static source code analysis tool for Symbian OS programs written in C++. CodeScanner behaves differently depending upon the type of resource selected in the C/C++ Project, Navigator, Project Explorer, or Symbian Project Navigator views: </p>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>project, folder, or file </strong> - scans the project associated with the selected project, folder, or file </li>
     <li><strong>MMP file</strong> - scans the selected .MMP file, plus any user include path(s)/source file(s)/resource file(s) listed in the .MMP file</li>
     <li><strong>INF file</strong> - scans the selected .INF file, plus any .MMP file(s) listed in that .INF file, as well as the user include path(s)/source file(s)/resource file(s) listed in the .MMP file(s)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>You can run CodeScanner using either of these methods:</p>
