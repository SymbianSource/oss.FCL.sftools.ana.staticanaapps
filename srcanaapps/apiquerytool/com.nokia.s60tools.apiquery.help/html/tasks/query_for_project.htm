<h2>Running an API query for a project</h2>
<p>You can generate a report of the usage of APIs throughout your active project from the context menu. 
You can access the context menu either by right-clicking any <i>.cpp</i> or <i>.h</i> file or any folder in the C/C++ Projects view, or by right-clicking your code anywhere in the editor.</p>

<p>The report is a table in HTML format and is named as <code>[name]-project_is_using_APIs.html</code> by default. You can view it in Carbide's internal browser or in any Web browser.</p>
<p>To run a query for a project, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li> Right-click the item of your choice and from the pop-up menu, select <b>API Query > for Active Project</b>.</li>
<li>In the <b>Save As</b> dialog, select the location for saving the query report within your project and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>When the report has been generated, click <b>OK</b> in the confirmation dialog to view it right away. <p>The report is opened to Carbide's internal browser. See the following figure for an example:</p>
<p><img src="screenshots\sample_api_report.png"></p>
<p>You can perform operations by clicking the underlined links in the report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click an item in the <b>API Name</b>, <b>Subsystem</b>, or <b>Libs</b> column to start an API Query with the selected API name, subsystem or library as the search string and a preselected query type.</li>
<li>Click an item in the <b>Used headers</b> or <b>Using files</b> column to open the selected file.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: You can only open links from the report when the API Query Carbide.c++ Extension is running.</p>
</li>
</ol>
