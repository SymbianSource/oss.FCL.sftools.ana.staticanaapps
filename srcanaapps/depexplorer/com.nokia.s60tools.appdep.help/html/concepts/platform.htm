<h2>Software Development Kit (SDK)</h2>
<p>Dependency Explorer is used to analyse components in S60 or custom platforms included within Software Development Kits (SDKs). SDKs contain the tools, documentation and code examples that support the development of applications.</p>
<p>To install SDKs to Carbide.c++, go to <b>Window > Preferences > Carbide.c++ > SDK Preferences > Add New SDK</b>, and select the SDK to be added. </p>
<p class="note"><b class="note">NOTE</b> To get full advantage of Dependency Explorer, consider the following when adding SDKs.</p>
<p>You can analyse Symbian OS SDKs with this tool.</p>

<p>If you install Symbian SDK, you can analyse dependencies to the components you have
developed yourself, and to the system library components that are directly used by your
components. In this case, it is enough to have dynamic shared object (.dso) and/or import
library (.lib) files available for the system libraries included in the analysis. The existence
of system library components themselves is not required.
If you need in-depth analysis of the available component, you need to install a platform SDK.
</p>

<p>For more information, see <b>SDK Support</b> under the general Carbide.c++ help.</p>
