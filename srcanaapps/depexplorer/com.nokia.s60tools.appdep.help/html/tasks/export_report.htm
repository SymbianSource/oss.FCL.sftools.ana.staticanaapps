<h2>Exporting the report</h2>
<p>Dependency Explorer offers a functionality to share the results of the analysis by exporting them as an HTML file. The exported report shows the structure of the component tree and lists the properties information, as well as the exported and imported functions of all the components.</p>
<p>To export a report:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click a component and from the pop-up menu, select <b>Export report...</b>
<p>The content of the report is generated based on the component that was clicked. If you selected the root component, the report will include the entire tree hierarchy. If the selected component was from a lower level, the report will only include the component tree hierarchy from that component downwards.</p></li>
<li>In the <b>Export Report</b> dialog, specify the location for the report and click <b>Save</b>. </li>
</ol>
