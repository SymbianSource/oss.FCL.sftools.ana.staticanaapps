59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br> &nbsp;Everyone
is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br> &nbsp;of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br> <br> &nbsp; The licenses
for most software are designed to take away your<br> freedom to share and
change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br> License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br> software--to make sure
the software is free for all its users.&nbsp; This<br> General Public License
applies to most of the Free Software<br> Foundation's software and to any
other program whose authors commit to<br> using it.&nbsp; (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by<br> the GNU Library General Public
License instead.)&nbsp; You can apply it to<br> your programs, too.<br> <br> &nbsp;
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br> price.&nbsp;
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br> have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br> this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br> if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br> in new free programs;
and that you know you can do these things.<br> <br> &nbsp; To protect your
rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br> anyone to deny you these
rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br> These restrictions translate
to certain responsibilities for you if you<br> distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it.<br> <br> &nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies
of such a program, whether<br> gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients
all the rights that<br> you have.&nbsp; You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the<br> source code.&nbsp; And you must show them these
terms so they know their<br> rights.<br> <br> &nbsp; We protect your rights
with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br> (2) offer you this license
which gives you legal permission to copy,<br> distribute and/or modify the
software.<br> <br> &nbsp; Also, for each author's protection and ours, we
want to make certain<br> that everyone understands that there is no warranty
for this free<br> software.&nbsp; If the software is modified by someone else
and passed on, we<br> want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, so<br> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original<br> authors' reputations.<br> <br> &nbsp; Finally, any free
program is threatened constantly by software<br> patents.&nbsp; We wish to
avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br> program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br> program proprietary.&nbsp;
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br> patent must be licensed
for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br> <br> &nbsp; The precise
terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br> modification follow.<br>  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br> <br> &nbsp;
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br> a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br> under
the terms of this General Public License.&nbsp; The "Program", below,<br> refers
to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br> means either
the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br> that is to say,
a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br> either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another<br> language.&nbsp; (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in<br> the term "modification".)&nbsp;
Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br> <br> Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not<br> covered by this License; they are
outside its scope.&nbsp; The act of<br> running the Program is not restricted,
and the output from the Program<br> is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based on the<br> Program (independent of having been made by running
the Program).<br> Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br> <br> &nbsp;
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br> source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br> conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br> copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br> notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br> and give any other recipients
of the Program a copy of this License<br> along with the Program.<br> <br> You
may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br> you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br> <br> &nbsp;
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br> of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br> distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br> above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
parties under the terms of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) If
the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
License.&nbsp; (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>  <br> These requirements
apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br> identifiable sections
of that work are not derived from the Program,<br> and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in<br> themselves, then this License, and its
terms, do not apply to those<br> sections when you distribute them as separate
works.&nbsp; But when you<br> distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based<br> on the Program, the distribution of the whole must
be on the terms of<br> this License, whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the<br> entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
of who wrote it.<br> <br> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim
rights or contest<br> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
the intent is to<br> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative
or<br> collective works based on the Program.<br> <br> In addition, mere aggregation
of another work not based on the Program<br> with the Program (or with a work
based on the Program) on a volume of<br> a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under<br> the scope of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp;
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br> under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br> Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to distribute corresponding source code.&nbsp; (This alternative is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
received the program in object code or executable form with such<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br> <br> The source code for
a work means the preferred form of the work for<br> making modifications to
it.&nbsp; For an executable work, complete source<br> code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any<br> associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to<br> control compilation and installation of
the executable.&nbsp; However, as a<br> special exception, the source code
distributed need not include<br> anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary<br> form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
and so on) of the<br> operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component<br> itself accompanies the executable.<br> <br> If distribution
of executable or object code is made by offering<br> access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent<br> access to copy the source code
from the same place counts as<br> distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not<br> compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.<br>  <br> &nbsp; 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Program<br> except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp; Any
attempt<br> otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
is<br> void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br> However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br> this License
will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br> parties remain
in full compliance.<br> <br> &nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this
License, since you have not<br> signed it.&nbsp; However, nothing else grants
you permission to modify or<br> distribute the Program or its derivative works.&nbsp;
These actions are<br> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp;
Therefore, by<br> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based
on the<br> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and<br> all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br> the
Program or works based on it.<br> <br> &nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute
the Program (or any work based on the<br> Program), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the<br> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify
the Program subject to<br> these terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose
any further<br> restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein.<br> You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
to<br> this License.<br> <br> &nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment
or allegation of patent<br> infringement or for any other reason (not limited
to patent issues),<br> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or<br> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
they do not<br> excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp; If you
cannot<br> distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this<br> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
you<br> may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp; For example, if a patent<br> license
would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br> all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br> the only way
you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br> refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program.<br> <br> If any portion of this section
is held invalid or unenforceable under<br> any particular circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to<br> apply and the section as a whole
is intended to apply in other<br> circumstances.<br> <br> It is not the purpose
of this section to induce you to infringe any<br> patents or other property
right claims or to contest validity of any<br> such claims; this section has
the sole purpose of protecting the<br> integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is<br> implemented by public license practices.&nbsp; Many people
have made<br> generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br> through
that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br> system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br> to distribute
software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br> impose that choice.<br> <br> This
section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br> be a
consequence of the rest of this License.<br>  <br> &nbsp; 8. If the distribution
and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br> certain countries either by
patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br> original copyright holder who
places the Program under this License<br> may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding<br> those countries, so that distribution
is permitted only in or among<br> countries not thus excluded.&nbsp; In such
case, this License incorporates<br> the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp; 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish
revised and/or new versions<br> of the General Public License from time to
time.&nbsp; Such new versions will<br> be similar in spirit to the present
version, but may differ in detail to<br> address new problems or concerns.<br> <br> Each
version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Program<br> specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br> later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br> either of that
version or of any later version published by the Free<br> Software Foundation.&nbsp;
If the Program does not specify a version number of<br> this License, you
may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br> Foundation.<br> <br> &nbsp;
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br> programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br> to ask
for permission.&nbsp; For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br> Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br> make exceptions
for this.&nbsp; Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br> of preserving
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br> of promoting
the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br> <br> &nbsp; 11.
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br> FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; EXCEPT WHEN<br> OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br> PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br> OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br> MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br> TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE<br> PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br> REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.<br> <br> &nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br> REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br> INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br> OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br> TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br> YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br> PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br> POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br> <br> &nbsp;
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br> possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br> free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br> <br> &nbsp;
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp; It is safest<br> to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br> convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br> the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Copyright (C) &lt;year>&nbsp; &lt;name of author><br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(at your option) any later version.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program

USA<br> <br> <br> Also add information on how to contact you by electronic

something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br> mouse-clicks
or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br> <br> You should also get your
employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br> school, if any, to sign
a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br> necessary.&nbsp; Here is
a sample; alter the names:<br> <br> &nbsp; Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims

General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br> proprietary
programs.&nbsp; If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br> consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br> library.&nbsp;
If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br> Public License
instead of this License. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Version 2.1, February 1999<br> <br> &nbsp;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software
Foundation, Inc.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br> &nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy
and distribute verbatim copies<br> &nbsp;of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.<br> <br> [This is the first released version of the Lesser
GPL.&nbsp; It also counts<br> &nbsp;as the successor of the GNU Library Public
License, version 2, hence<br> &nbsp;the version number 2.1.]<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br> <br> &nbsp;
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br> freedom
to share and change it.&nbsp; By contrast, the GNU General Public<br> Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br> free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.<br> <br> &nbsp; This license,
the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br> specially designated
software packages--typically libraries--of the<br> Free Software Foundation
and other authors who decide to use it.&nbsp; You<br> can use it too, but
we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br> this license or the
ordinary General Public License is the better<br> strategy to use in any particular
case, based on the explanations below.<br> <br> &nbsp; When we speak of free
software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br> not price.&nbsp; Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br> you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge<br> for this service if you
wish); that you receive source code or can get<br> it if you want it; that
you can change the software and use pieces of<br> it in new free programs;
and that you are informed that you can do<br> these things.<br> <br> &nbsp;
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br> distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br> rights.&nbsp;
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br> you if you
distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br> <br> &nbsp; For
example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br> or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br> you.&nbsp;
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br> code.&nbsp;
If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br> complete object
files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br> with the library
after making changes to the library and recompiling<br> it.&nbsp; And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br> <br> &nbsp; We protect
your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br> library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br> permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.<br> <br> &nbsp; To protect each distributor,
we want to make it very clear that<br> there is no warranty for the free library.&nbsp;
Also, if the library is<br> modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients
should know<br> that what they have is not the original version, so that the
original<br> author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might
be<br> introduced by others.<br>  <br> &nbsp; Finally, software patents pose
a constant threat to the existence of<br> any free program.&nbsp; We wish
to make sure that a company cannot<br> effectively restrict the users of a
free program by obtaining a<br> restrictive license from a patent holder.&nbsp;
Therefore, we insist that<br> any patent license obtained for a version of
the library must be<br> consistent with the full freedom of use specified
in this license.<br> <br> &nbsp; Most GNU software, including some libraries,
is covered by the<br> ordinary GNU General Public License.&nbsp; This license,
the GNU Lesser<br> General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,
and<br> is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&nbsp;
We use<br> this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br> libraries
into non-free programs.<br> <br> &nbsp; When a program is linked with a library,
whether statically or using<br> a shared library, the combination of the two
is legally speaking a<br> combined work, a derivative of the original library.&nbsp;
The ordinary<br> General Public License therefore permits such linking only
if the<br> entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.&nbsp; The Lesser
General<br> Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code
with<br> the library.<br> <br> &nbsp; We call this license the "Lesser" General
Public License because it<br> does Less to protect the user's freedom than
the ordinary General<br> Public License.&nbsp; It also provides other free
software developers Less<br> of an advantage over competing non-free programs.&nbsp;
These disadvantages<br> are the reason we use the ordinary General Public
License for many<br> libraries.&nbsp; However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain<br> special circumstances.<br> <br> &nbsp; For example,
on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br> encourage the widest
possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br> a de-facto standard.&nbsp;
To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br> allowed to use the library.&nbsp;
A more frequent case is that a free<br> library does the same job as widely
used non-free libraries.&nbsp; In this<br> case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free<br> software only, so we use the Lesser
General Public License.<br> <br> &nbsp; In other cases, permission to use
a particular library in non-free<br> programs enables a greater number of
people to use a large body of<br> free software.&nbsp; For example, permission
to use the GNU C Library in<br> non-free programs enables many more people
to use the whole GNU<br> operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux
operating<br> system.<br> <br> &nbsp; Although the Lesser General Public License
is Less protective of the<br> users' freedom, it does ensure that the user
of a program that is<br> linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal
to run<br> that program using a modified version of the Library.<br> <br> &nbsp;
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br> modification
follow.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the difference between a<br> "work based
on the library" and a "work that uses the library".&nbsp; The<br> former contains
code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br> be combined with
the library in order to run.<br>  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br> <br> &nbsp; 0. This License Agreement
applies to any software library or other<br> program which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder or<br> other authorized party saying it may
be distributed under the terms of<br> this Lesser General Public License (also
called "this License").<br> Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br> <br> &nbsp;
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br> prepared
so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br> (which use some
of those functions and data) to form executables.<br> <br> &nbsp; The "Library",
below, refers to any such software library or work<br> which has been distributed
under these terms.&nbsp; A "work based on the<br> Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under<br> copyright law: that is to say, a
work containing the Library or a<br> portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated<br> straightforwardly into another language.&nbsp;
(Hereinafter, translation is<br> included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br> <br> &nbsp;
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br> making
modifications to it.&nbsp; For a library, complete source code means<br> all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br> interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br> and installation
of the library.<br> <br> &nbsp; Activities other than copying, distribution
and modification are not<br> covered by this License; they are outside its
scope.&nbsp; The act of<br> running a program using the Library is not restricted,
and output from<br> such a program is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based<br> on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in
a tool for<br> writing it).&nbsp; Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does<br> and what the program that uses the Library does.<br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br> complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br> you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an<br> appropriate copyright notice
and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br> all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any<br> warranty; and distribute a copy
of this License along with the<br> Library.<br> <br> &nbsp; You may charge
a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br> and you may at your
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br> fee.<br>  <br> &nbsp;
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br> of
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br> distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br> above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)
The modified work must itself be a software library.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the event an application does not supply such function or<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
its purpose remains meaningful.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (For example,
a function in a library to compute square roots has<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
application.&nbsp; Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
root function must still compute square roots.)<br> <br> These requirements
apply to the modified work as a whole.&nbsp; If<br> identifiable sections
of that work are not derived from the Library,<br> and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in<br> themselves, then this License, and its
terms, do not apply to those<br> sections when you distribute them as separate
works.&nbsp; But when you<br> distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based<br> on the Library, the distribution of the whole must
be on the terms of<br> this License, whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the<br> entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
of who wrote<br> it.<br> <br> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to
claim rights or contest<br> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
the intent is to<br> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative
or<br> collective works based on the Library.<br> <br> In addition, mere aggregation
of another work not based on the Library<br> with the Library (or with a work
based on the Library) on a volume of<br> a storage or distribution medium
does not bring the other work under<br> the scope of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp;
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br> License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&nbsp; To do<br> this,
you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br> that they
refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br> instead of
to this License.&nbsp; (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br> ordinary
GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br> that version
instead if you wish.)&nbsp; Do not make any other change in<br> these notices.<br>  <br> &nbsp;
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br> that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br> subsequent
copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br> <br> &nbsp; This option
is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br> the Library into a
program that is not a library.<br> <br> &nbsp; 4. You may copy and distribute
the Library (or a portion or<br> derivative of it, under Section 2) in object
code or executable form<br> under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you accompany<br> it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which<br> must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above on a<br> medium customarily used for software interchange.<br> <br> &nbsp;
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br> from
a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br> source
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br> distribute the source
code, even though third parties are not<br> compelled to copy the source along
with the object code.<br> <br> &nbsp; 5. A program that contains no derivative
of any portion of the<br> Library, but is designed to work with the Library
by being compiled or<br> linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".&nbsp;
Such a<br> work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br> therefore
falls outside the scope of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp; However, linking
a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br> creates an executable
that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br> contains portions of the
Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br> library".&nbsp; The executable
is therefore covered by this License.<br> Section 6 states terms for distribution
of such executables.<br> <br> &nbsp; When a "work that uses the Library" uses
material from a header file<br> that is part of the Library, the object code
for the work may be a<br> derivative work of the Library even though the source
code is not.<br> Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
can be<br> linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&nbsp;
The<br> threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br> <br> &nbsp;
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br> structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br> functions (ten
lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br> file is unrestricted,
regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br> work.&nbsp; (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the<br> Library will still fall
under Section 6.)<br> <br> &nbsp; Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of
the Library, you may<br> distribute the object code for the work under the
terms of Section 6.<br> Any executables containing that work also fall under
Section 6,<br> whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br>  <br> &nbsp;
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br> link
a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br> work containing
portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br> under terms of your
choice, provided that the terms permit<br> modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse<br> engineering for debugging such modifications.<br> <br> &nbsp;
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br> Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br> this License.&nbsp;
You must supply a copy of this License.&nbsp; If the work<br> during execution
displays copyright notices, you must include the<br> copyright notice for
the Library among them, as well as a reference<br> directing the user to the
copy of this License.&nbsp; Also, you must do one<br> of these things:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
executable containing the modified Library.&nbsp; (It is understood<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to use the modified definitions.)<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Use a suitable
shared library mechanism for linking with the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Library.&nbsp;
A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
least three years, to give the same user the materials<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
than the cost of performing this distribution.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
specified materials from the same place.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Verify
that the user has already received a copy of these<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br> <br> &nbsp;
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br> Library"
must include any data and utility programs needed for<br> reproducing the
executable from it.&nbsp; However, as a special exception,<br> the materials
to be distributed need not include anything that is<br> normally distributed
(in either source or binary form) with the major<br> components (compiler,
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br> which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompanies<br> the executable.<br> <br> &nbsp;
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br> restrictions
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br> accompany the operating
system.&nbsp; Such a contradiction means you cannot<br> use both them and
the Library together in an executable that you<br> distribute.<br>  <br> &nbsp;
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br> Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br> facilities
not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br> library, provided
that the separate distribution of the work based on<br> the Library and of
the other library facilities is otherwise<br> permitted, and provided that
you do these two things:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Accompany the combined
library with a copy of the same work<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facilities.&nbsp;
This must be distributed under the terms of the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections
above.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Give prominent notice with the combined
library of the fact<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that part of it is a work based
on the Library, and explaining<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.<br> <br> &nbsp; 8. You may not copy, modify,
sublicense, link with, or distribute<br> the Library except as expressly provided
under this License.&nbsp; Any<br> attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
link with, or<br> distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
your<br> rights under this License.&nbsp; However, parties who have received
copies,<br> or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br> terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br> <br> &nbsp; 9. You
are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br> signed it.&nbsp;
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br> distribute the
Library or its derivative works.&nbsp; These actions are<br> prohibited by
law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp; Therefore, by<br> modifying or
distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br> Library), you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br> all its terms and conditions
for copying, distributing or modifying<br> the Library or works based on it.<br> <br> &nbsp;
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br> Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br> original licensor
to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br> subject to these
terms and conditions.&nbsp; You may not impose any further<br> restrictions
on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br> You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br> this License.<br>  <br> &nbsp;
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br> infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br> conditions are
imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br> otherwise) that contradict
the conditions of this License, they do not<br> excuse you from the conditions
of this License.&nbsp; If you cannot<br> distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this<br> License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you<br> may not distribute the Library at all.&nbsp;
For example, if a patent<br> license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Library by<br> all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then<br> the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
would be to<br> refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br> <br> If
any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br> particular
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br> and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br> <br> It
is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br> patents
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br> such claims;
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br> integrity of the free
software distribution system which is<br> implemented by public license practices.&nbsp;
Many people have made<br> generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed<br> through that system in reliance on consistent application
of that<br> system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing<br> to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot<br> impose that choice.<br> <br> This section is intended to make thoroughly
clear what is believed to<br> be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp;
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br> certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br> original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br> an
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br> so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br> excluded.&nbsp;
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br> written in
the body of this License.<br> <br> &nbsp; 13. The Free Software Foundation
may publish revised and/or new<br> versions of the Lesser General Public License
from time to time.<br> Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present version,<br> but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br> <br> Each
version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp; If the Library<br> specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and<br> "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and<br> conditions either of that
version or of any later version published by<br> the Free Software Foundation.&nbsp;
If the Library does not specify a<br> license version number, you may choose
any version ever published by<br> the Free Software Foundation.<br>  <br> &nbsp;
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br> programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br> write to the
author to ask for permission.&nbsp; For software which is<br> copyrighted
by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br> Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this.&nbsp; Our<br> decision will be guided
by the two goals of preserving the free status<br> of all derivatives of our
free software and of promoting the sharing<br> and reuse of software generally.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO WARRANTY<br> <br> &nbsp;
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br> WARRANTY
FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br> EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br> OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br> KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br> IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br> PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br> LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.&nbsp; SHOULD THE LIBRARY
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br> THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.<br> <br> &nbsp; 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY<br> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU<br> FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
OR<br> CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br> LIBRARY
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br> RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br> FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br> SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br> DAMAGES.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br> <br> &nbsp; If you develop
a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br> possible use to the
public, we recommend making it free software that<br> everyone can redistribute
and change.&nbsp; You can do so by permitting<br> redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br> ordinary General Public
License).<br> <br> &nbsp; To apply these terms, attach the following notices
to the library.&nbsp; It is<br> safest to attach them to the start of each
source file to most effectively<br> convey the exclusion of warranty; and
each file should have at least the<br> "copyright" line and a pointer to where
the full notice is found.<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give
the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Foundation, Inc.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
Boston, MA&nbsp; 02111-1307&nbsp; USA<br> &nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy
and distribute verbatim copies<br> &nbsp;of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.<br> <br> <br> 0. PREAMBLE<br> <br> The purpose of this
License is to make a manual, textbook, or other<br> functional and useful
document "free" in the sense of freedom: to<br> assure everyone the effective
freedom to copy and redistribute it,<br> with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially.<br> Secondarily, this License preserves for
the author and publisher a way<br> to get credit for their work, while not
being considered responsible<br> for modifications made by others.<br> <br> This
License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative<br> works of
the document must themselves be free in the same sense.&nbsp; It<br> complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft<br> license designed for
free software.<br> <br> We have designed this License in order to use it for
manuals for free<br> software, because free software needs free documentation:
a free<br> program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that
the<br> software does.&nbsp; But this License is not limited to software manuals;<br> it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or<br> whether
it is published as a printed book.&nbsp; We recommend this License<br> principally
for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.<br> <br> <br> 1. APPLICABILITY
AND DEFINITIONS<br> <br> This License applies to any manual or other work,
in any medium, that<br> contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
it can be<br> distributed under the terms of this License.&nbsp; Such a notice
grants a<br> world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
that<br> work under the conditions stated herein.&nbsp; The "Document", below,<br> refers
to any such manual or work.&nbsp; Any member of the public is a<br> licensee,
and is addressed as "you".&nbsp; You accept the license if you<br> copy, modify
or distribute the work in a way requiring permission<br> under copyright law.<br> <br> A
"Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the<br> Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with<br> modifications and/or
translated into another language.<br> <br> A "Secondary Section" is a named
appendix or a front-matter section of<br> the Document that deals exclusively
with the relationship of the<br> publishers or authors of the Document to
the Document's overall subject<br> (or to related matters) and contains nothing
that could fall directly<br> within that overall subject.&nbsp; (Thus, if
the Document is in part a<br> textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section
may not explain any<br> mathematics.)&nbsp; The relationship could be a matter
of historical<br> connection with the subject or with related matters, or
of legal,<br> commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding<br> them.<br> <br> The
"Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles<br> are designated,
as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice<br> that says that the
Document is released under this License.&nbsp; If a<br> section does not fit
the above definition of Secondary then it is not<br> allowed to be designated
as Invariant.&nbsp; The Document may contain zero<br> Invariant Sections.&nbsp;
If the Document does not identify any Invariant<br> Sections then there are
none.<br> <br> The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
listed,<br> as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
that<br> the Document is released under this License.&nbsp; A Front-Cover
Text may<br> be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.<br> <br> A
"Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,<br> represented
in a format whose specification is available to the<br> general public, that
is suitable for revising the document<br> straightforwardly with generic text
editors or (for images composed of<br> pixels) generic paint programs or (for
drawings) some widely available<br> drawing editor, and that is suitable for
input to text formatters or<br> for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input<br> to text formatters.&nbsp; A copy made in an
otherwise Transparent file<br> format whose markup, or absence of markup,
has been arranged to thwart<br> or discourage subsequent modification by readers
is not Transparent.<br> An image format is not Transparent if used for any
substantial amount<br> of text.&nbsp; A copy that is not "Transparent" is
called "Opaque".<br> <br> Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies
include plain<br> ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML<br> or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
simple<br> HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.&nbsp;
Examples of<br> transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.&nbsp;
Opaque formats<br> include proprietary formats that can be read and edited
only by<br> proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or<br> processing
tools are not generally available, and the<br> machine-generated HTML, PostScript
or PDF produced by some word<br> processors for output purposes only.<br> <br> The
"Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,<br> plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material<br> this License
requires to appear in the title page.&nbsp; For works in<br> formats which
do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means<br> the text near the
most prominent appearance of the work's title,<br> preceding the beginning
of the body of the text.<br> <br> A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
of the Document whose<br> title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
parentheses following<br> text that translates XYZ in another language.&nbsp;
(Here XYZ stands for a<br> specific section name mentioned below, such as
"Acknowledgements",<br> "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)&nbsp;
To "Preserve the Title"<br> of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a<br> section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.<br> <br> The
Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which<br> states
that this License applies to the Document.&nbsp; These Warranty<br> Disclaimers
are considered to be included by reference in this<br> License, but only as
regards disclaiming warranties: any other<br> implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has<br> no effect on the meaning of this
License.<br> <br> <br> 2. VERBATIM COPYING<br> <br> You may copy and distribute
the Document in any medium, either<br> commercially or noncommercially, provided
that this License, the<br> copyright notices, and the license notice saying
this License applies<br> to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
that you add no other<br> conditions whatsoever to those of this License.&nbsp;
You may not use<br> technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further<br> copying of the copies you make or distribute.&nbsp; However,
you may accept<br> compensation in exchange for copies.&nbsp; If you distribute
a large enough<br> number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
section 3.<br> <br> You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
above, and<br> you may publicly display copies.<br> <br> <br> 3. COPYING IN
QUANTITY<br> <br> If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
have<br> printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the<br> Document's
license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the<br> copies in covers
that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover<br> Texts: Front-Cover Texts
on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on<br> the back cover.&nbsp; Both
covers must also clearly and legibly identify<br> you as the publisher of
these copies.&nbsp; The front cover must present<br> the full title with all
words of the title equally prominent and<br> visible.&nbsp; You may add other
material on the covers in addition.<br> Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve<br> the title of the Document and satisfy
these conditions, can be treated<br> as verbatim copying in other respects.<br> <br> If
the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit<br> legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit<br> reasonably) on the
actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent<br> pages.<br> <br> If you
publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering<br> more than
100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent<br> copy along
with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy<br> a computer-network
location from which the general network-using<br> public has access to download
using public-standard network protocols<br> a complete Transparent copy of
the Document, free of added material.<br> If you use the latter option, you
must take reasonably prudent steps,<br> when you begin distribution of Opaque
copies in quantity, to ensure<br> that this Transparent copy will remain thus
accessible at the stated<br> location until at least one year after the last
time you distribute an<br> Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
retailers) of that<br> edition to the public.<br> <br> It is requested, but
not required, that you contact the authors of the<br> Document well before
redistributing any large number of copies, to give<br> them a chance to provide
you with an updated version of the Document.<br> <br> <br> 4. MODIFICATIONS<br> <br> You
may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under<br> the conditions
of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release<br> the Modified Version
under precisely this License, with the Modified<br> Version filling the role
of the Document, thus licensing distribution<br> and modification of the Modified
Version to whoever possesses a copy<br> of it.&nbsp; In addition, you must
do these things in the Modified Version:<br> <br> A. Use in the Title Page
(and on the covers, if any) a title distinct<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; from that of
the Document, and from those of previous versions<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; (which
should, if there were any, be listed in the History section<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
of the Document).&nbsp; You may use the same title as a previous version<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.<br> B. List on
the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
unless they release you from this requirement.<br> C. State on the Title page
the name of the publisher of the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Modified Version, as the
publisher.<br> D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.<br> E.
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
adjacent to the other copyright notices.<br> F. Include, immediately after
the copyright notices, a license notice<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; giving the public
permission to use the Modified Version under the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; terms of
this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.<br> G. Preserve in
that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.<br> H. Include
an unaltered copy of this License.<br> I. Preserve the section Entitled "History",
Preserve its Title, and add<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; to it an item stating at least
the title, year, new authors, and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; publisher of the Modified
Version as given on the Title Page.&nbsp; If<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; there is no
section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; stating
the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
Version as stated in the previous sentence.<br> J. Preserve the network location,
if any, given in the Document for<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; public access to a Transparent
copy of the Document, and likewise<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; the network locations
given in the Document for previous versions<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; it was based
on.&nbsp; These may be placed in the "History" section.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; You
may omit a network location for a work that was published at<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.<br> K. For any section
Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Preserve the
Title of the section, and preserve in the section all<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
and/or dedications given therein.<br> L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections
of the Document,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; unaltered in their text and in their titles.&nbsp;
Section numbers<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; or the equivalent are not considered part
of the section titles.<br> M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".&nbsp;
Such a section<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; may not be included in the Modified Version.<br> N.
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.<br> O. Preserve any Warranty
Disclaimers.<br> <br> If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
or<br> appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material<br> copied
from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all<br> of these
sections as invariant.&nbsp; To do this, add their titles to the<br> list
of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.<br> These
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.<br> <br> You may add
a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains<br> nothing but endorsements
of your Modified Version by various<br> parties--for example, statements of
peer review or that the text has<br> been approved by an organization as the
authoritative definition of a<br> standard.<br> <br> You may add a passage
of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a<br> passage of up to 25 words
as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list<br> of Cover Texts in the Modified
Version.&nbsp; Only one passage of<br> Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover
Text may be added by (or<br> through arrangements made by) any one entity.&nbsp;
If the Document already<br> includes a cover text for the same cover, previously
added by you or<br> by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting
on behalf of,<br> you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit<br> permission from the previous publisher that added the old
one.<br> <br> The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
License<br> give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert
or<br> imply endorsement of any Modified Version.<br> <br> <br> 5. COMBINING
DOCUMENTS<br> <br> You may combine the Document with other documents released
under this<br> License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified<br> versions,
provided that you include in the combination all of the<br> Invariant Sections
of all of the original documents, unmodified, and<br> list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its<br> license notice, and that you preserve
all their Warranty Disclaimers.<br> <br> The combined work need only contain
one copy of this License, and<br> multiple identical Invariant Sections may
be replaced with a single<br> copy.&nbsp; If there are multiple Invariant
Sections with the same name but<br> different contents, make the title of
each such section unique by<br> adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
name of the original<br> author or publisher of that section if known, or
else a unique number.<br> Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
the list of<br> Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.<br> <br> In
the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"<br> in the
various original documents, forming one section Entitled<br> "History"; likewise
combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",<br> and any sections Entitled
"Dedications".&nbsp; You must delete all sections<br> Entitled "Endorsements".<br> <br> <br> 6.
COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS<br> <br> You may make a collection consisting of
the Document and other documents<br> released under this License, and replace
the individual copies of this<br> License in the various documents with a
single copy that is included in<br> the collection, provided that you follow
the rules of this License for<br> verbatim copying of each of the documents
in all other respects.<br> <br> You may extract a single document from such
a collection, and distribute<br> it individually under this License, provided
you insert a copy of this<br> License into the extracted document, and follow
this License in all<br> other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.<br> <br> <br> 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS<br> <br> A compilation
of the Document or its derivatives with other separate<br> and independent
documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or<br> distribution medium,
is called an "aggregate" if the copyright<br> resulting from the compilation
is not used to limit the legal rights<br> of the compilation's users beyond
what the individual works permit.<br> When the Document is included in an
aggregate, this License does not<br> apply to the other works in the aggregate
which are not themselves<br> derivative works of the Document.<br> <br> If
the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these<br> copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of<br> the entire
aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on<br> covers that bracket
the Document within the aggregate, or the<br> electronic equivalent of covers
if the Document is in electronic form.<br> Otherwise they must appear on printed
covers that bracket the whole<br> aggregate.<br> <br> <br> 8. TRANSLATION<br> <br> Translation
is considered a kind of modification, so you may<br> distribute translations
of the Document under the terms of section 4.<br> Replacing Invariant Sections
with translations requires special<br> permission from their copyright holders,
but you may include<br> translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the<br> original versions of these Invariant Sections.&nbsp; You
may include a<br> translation of this License, and all the license notices
in the<br> Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
include<br> the original English version of this License and the original
versions<br> of those notices and disclaimers.&nbsp; In case of a disagreement
between<br> the translation and the original version of this License or a
notice<br> or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.<br> <br> If a
section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",<br> "Dedications",
or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve<br> its Title (section
1) will typically require changing the actual<br> title.<br> <br> <br> 9.
TERMINATION<br> <br> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
Document except<br> as expressly provided for under this License.&nbsp; Any
other attempt to<br> copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
void, and will<br> automatically terminate your rights under this License.&nbsp;
However,<br> parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this<br> License
will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br> parties remain
in full compliance.<br> <br> <br> 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE<br> <br> The
Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions<br> of the GNU
Free Documentation License from time to time.&nbsp; Such new<br> versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br> differ in detail
to address new problems or concerns.&nbsp; See<br> http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.<br> <br> Each
version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.<br> If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this<br> License
"or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of<br> following
the terms and conditions either of that specified version or<br> of any later
version that has been published (not as a draft) by the<br> Free Software
Foundation.&nbsp; If the Document does not specify a version<br> number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published (not<br> as a draft)
by the Free Software Foundation.<br> <br> <br> ADDENDUM: How to use this License
for your documents<br> <br> To use this License in a document you have written,
include a copy of<br> the License in the document and put the following copyright
and<br> license notices just after the title page:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Copyright (c)&nbsp; YEAR&nbsp; YOUR NAME.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permission
is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Free Documentation License".<br> <br> If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover
Texts and Back-Cover Texts,<br> replace the "with...Texts." line with this:<br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.<br> <br> If
you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other<br> combination
of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the<br> situation.<br> <br> If
your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we<br> recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of<br> free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License,<br> to permit their use in
free software.<small><small><br></small></small></p>
